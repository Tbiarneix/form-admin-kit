#Form Admin Kit

## Description

This reporsitory is like a boiler plate. It offers a base to create basic forms in React using additional libraries.
The chosen libraries are known and followed by the community and maintained regularly.

## React Hook Form

For the form management part, we chose to use React Hook Form. It is one of the most used React libraries for form management. It allows great flexibility, while taking care of a large part of the data management logic. However, we have the possibility to customize components or functions if we want.

## Yup

For data validation, we chose to work with Yup. Several schema validation libraries work with React Hook Form (like Joi for example) but we chose Yup which seems to be the best implemented and especially the most popular by RHF. It is also well supported and regularly updated in addition to having been designed to work with Typescript at the base.

## Material UI

Material UI is a library of React UI components that implements Google's Material Design. The customization of form appearance is often delicate and MUI proposes us pre-existing components easy to use. They accept many parameters in order to adapt to a maximum of situations. Moreover they are continuously maintained by google, which makes it a solid and durable solution.
